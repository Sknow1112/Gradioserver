What's the capital of Puerto Rico?,"

The capital of Puerto Rico is San Juan. However, it's worth noting that San Juan is both a city and the capital, which can sometimes cause confusion, as Puerto Rico itself is an island territory of the United States. The distinction is important because there are other places in the world named ""San Juan"" that are not in Puerto Rico."

The capital of Puerto Rico is San Juan, which is also one of the island's major cities. However, if you're referring to the political status of Puerto Rico, it is a self-governing territory of the United States, and as such, it does not have a ""capital"" in the traditional sense. The largest city with municipal status is San Juan. Additionally, the government of Puerto Rico operates out of different locations, including the Paseo de Portau Prince, commonly known as ""La Fortaleza,"" which serves as the Governor's official residence and office."
